I've been working on an onset detection algorithm and now I made it a seperate project so that

a) nerdy users can build it and use it as VST3 plugin.
the plugin produces audio impulses and sends midi sysex messages on onsets,
so you can use this in your project somehow to trigger stuff

b) devs can fork the project to get a nice starting point for a working onset detector.
please feel free to send pull requests if you make improvements! :)
